## Goals

Easy way to get my setup up and running on any computer (GNU/Linux btw)
Currently supporting only `Ubuntu` but additional distros can be added for each role

## How to setup env

1. Get ansible on your system asap

```
mkdir personal
cd personal
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyf0rk/dev/master/resources/setup | sh
```
